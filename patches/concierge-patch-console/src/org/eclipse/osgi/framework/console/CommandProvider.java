/**
 When an object wants to provide a number of commands
 to the console, it should register an object with this
 interface. Some console can then pick this up and execute
 command lines.
 The SERVICE_RANKING registration property can be used to influence the
 order that a CommandProvider gets called.  Specify a value less than
 Integer.MAXVALUE, where higher is more significant.  The default value
 if SERVICE_RANKING is not set is 0.
 <p>
 The interface contains only methods for the help.
 The console should use inspection
 to find the commands. All public commands, starting with
 a '_' and taking a CommandInterpreter as parameter
 will be found. E.g.
 <pre>
 public Object _hello( CommandInterpreter intp ) {
 return "hello " + intp.nextArgument();
 }
 </pre>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * @since 3.1
